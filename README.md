This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# TODO | Reserve - Title
# TODO | Search - Loading / Error / Not-found / Title

## After update to version 13.3.0 - "use client" made the app break with parse/type error, so i just changed to arrow function, that works
## Version 13.3.0 head.t/jsx deprecated, tags header with metadada above body component works fine - Solution: Migrate the metada and main estructure to the layout.j(t)sx

## We can change the nested components tile, statically, this way:
                        export const metadata = {
                          title: "your title"
                        }                       
After close export function at layout page



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# TODO | Reserve - Title

# TODO | Search - Loading / Error / Not-found / Title

## After update to version 13.3.0 - "use client" made the app break with parse/type error, so i just changed to arrow function, that works

## Version 13.3.0 head.t/jsx deprecated, tags header with metadada above body component works fine - Solution: Migrate the metada and main estructure to the layout.j(t)sx

## We can change the nested components tile, statically, this way:

                        export const metadata = {
                          title: "your title"
                        }

After close export function at layout page
